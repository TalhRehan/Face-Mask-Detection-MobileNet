I developed a Real-Time Face Mask Detection System to address public health needs using MobileNetV2 for efficient image classification.

Key Features:

Data Preparation: Utilized ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation, enhancing model robustness.

Model Architecture: Built a custom CNN model with MobileNetV2, incorporating Average Pooling and Dropout layers for improved accuracy.

Real-Time Detection: Implemented a live video processing script with OpenCV for detecting faces and predicting mask status instantly.

Technical Skills:
Proficient in TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning, and OpenCV for computer vision tasks.
Strong understanding of machine learning principles, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

This project showcases my capability to develop AI-driven solutions tailored to real-world challenges. I am ready to assist clients in creating innovative applications that meet their specific needs.
